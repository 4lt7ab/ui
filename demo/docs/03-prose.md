# Prose

`@4lt7ab/content` is the long-form half of the library — everything you need to turn a paragraph of text into a reading surface. The same `Markdown` component that renders this page ships to consumers unchanged, and the typographic rules it uses (lead paragraphs, overlined h2s, three-dot section breaks, margin notes, pull quotes) are what every other component's copy should feel at home next to.

## What this concept covers

| Component | What it's for |
|---|---|
| `Markdown` | Render a markdown string with GFM, heading anchors, copy-to-clipboard, and optional click-to-edit. |
| `Prose` | Render arbitrary React children with the library's reading typography applied. |
| `Quote` | Serif-italic blockquote with `pull` and `epigraph` variants. |
| `MarginNote` | Annotation that inlines on mobile and floats into the page margin on wide screens. |
| `ThinkingCycle` | Inline text that scrambles-and-settles through a list of words. |

Import everything from `@4lt7ab/content` (or from `@4lt7ab/ui/content`, which routes to the same package):

```tsx
import { Markdown, Prose, Quote, MarginNote, ThinkingCycle } from '@4lt7ab/content';
```

## `Markdown`

The component responsible for rendering this page. Takes a markdown source string as `children` and produces a fully-styled block with heading anchors, GFM tables and task lists, callout blocks, and a copy-to-clipboard button on every code fence.

```tsx
import { Markdown } from '@4lt7ab/content';

const source = `
# Hello

A first paragraph styles as a lead — larger serif, tighter leading.

## Sections

Every h2 carries an overline rule.
`;

<Markdown>{source}</Markdown>
```

Edit the left pane to see exactly what `<Markdown>` produces from the same input the docs site itself consumes:

<LiveExample id="prose-markdown-editor" />

**Features applied automatically:**

- **GitHub Flavored Markdown** — tables, strikethrough, autolinks, task lists (via `remark-gfm`).
- **Heading anchors** — every `h1`–`h6` gets an `id` slugified from its text and a hover-visible link icon for shareable URLs.
- **Callouts** — `> [!NOTE]`, `> [!TIP]`, `> [!IMPORTANT]`, `> [!WARNING]`, `> [!CAUTION]` blockquote prefixes render as labeled callout cards (GitHub-compatible syntax).
- **Code blocks with copy button** — every fenced ` ```lang ` block renders a hover-visible copy button.
- **Copy-as-markdown button** — the whole document has a top-right button that copies its raw source.

**Editable mode.** Pass `editable` to opt into a three-state UI: empty-state placeholder (no children), read-only display (click to start editing), and a textarea with Save/Cancel controls (when `editing` is true). Keyboard shortcuts: `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter` to save, `Escape` to cancel.

```tsx
const [editing, setEditing] = useState(false);
const [draft, setDraft] = useState(saved);

<Markdown
  editable
  editing={editing}
  value={draft}
  onStartEdit={() => setEditing(true)}
  onEditChange={setDraft}
  onSave={() => { persist(draft); setEditing(false); }}
  onCancel={() => { setDraft(saved); setEditing(false); }}
  fieldLabel="Summary"
  placeholder="Click to add a summary…"
  rows={6}
>
  {saved}
</Markdown>
```

When `editable` is off, `Markdown` behaves exactly as the read-only renderer — there's no hidden branch that changes layout.

**Props.**

| Prop | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `children` | `string \| null` | — | Saved markdown source. Required in read-only mode. In editable mode, an empty/null value shows the placeholder. |
| `editable` | `boolean` | `false` | Opt into click-to-edit. |
| `editing` | `boolean` | `false` | Whether the editor is active. Only meaningful with `editable`. |
| `value` | `string` | — | Textarea value during editing. Only meaningful with `editable` + `editing`. |
| `onStartEdit` | `() => void` | — | Fires on click to the read view or placeholder. |
| `onEditChange` | `(value: string) => void` | — | Fires on every textarea change. |
| `onSave` | `() => void` | — | Fires on Save button or `Cmd/Ctrl+Enter`. |
| `onCancel` | `() => void` | — | Fires on Cancel button or `Escape`. |
| `fieldLabel` | `string` | — | Accessible label for the editable section. |
| `rows` | `number` | `4` | Textarea rows when editing. |
| `placeholder` | `string` | `'Click to add content...'` | Placeholder copy for the empty state. |
| `components` | `Record<string, ComponentType<any>>` | — | Element overrides merged on top of the built-in set (headings, `pre`, `blockquote`, `tbody`). Built-ins win on tag names they already cover; consumer keys populate everything else. |
| `remarkPlugins` | `PluggableList` | — | Additional remark plugins appended after the built-in `remark-gfm`. Used together with `components` to embed React islands. |
| `id` | `string` | — | Optional `id` on the rendered root element. |
| `data-testid` | `string` | — | Optional test id. |

### Embedding React islands — the `components` + `remarkPlugins` seam

`components` and `remarkPlugins` compose into the seam this docs site uses to embed every `<LiveExample>` you see on these pages. The pattern:

1. Write a remark plugin that walks the mdast tree, finds the syntax you want to capture (an HTML block like `<MyTag id="..." />`, a directive, a special fenced block), and rewrites the matching node to emit a custom hast element via `data.hName` and `data.hProperties`.
2. Pass that plugin in `remarkPlugins`, and pair it with a matching key in `components` that points at the React component to render.

```tsx
import { Markdown } from '@4lt7ab/content';
import { remarkLiveExample } from './remarkLiveExample';
import { LiveExample } from './LiveExample';

<Markdown
  remarkPlugins={[remarkLiveExample]}
  components={{ liveexample: LiveExample }}
>
  {source}
</Markdown>
```

A worked reference implementation lives in this repo at `demo/examples/remarkLiveExample.ts` (the mdast plugin) and `demo/examples/LiveExample.tsx` (the renderer). Together they turn `<LiveExample id="..." />` HTML blocks in the markdown source into real React components rendered inline with the prose, with full access to React state, hooks, and the surrounding theme.

The seam is intentionally small — there's no plugin runtime, no DSL, no manifest. A remark plugin emits a tag name; `components` provides the React component for that tag name. The same pattern works for any in-prose embedding need: callout overrides, custom code-fence renderers, embedded charts, interactive demos.

## `Prose`

`Markdown` is for source strings. `Prose` is for arbitrary React children: a blog post rendered from CMS blocks, a docs page that mixes prose with custom React islands, a changelog built from a structured data file.

```tsx
import { Prose, Quote, MarginNote } from '@4lt7ab/content';

<Prose>
  <p>A first-child paragraph styles as a lead — the same rule as Markdown.</p>
  <p>Subsequent paragraphs use the body size.</p>

  <h2>A section</h2>
  <p>h2s carry an overline rule anchored to the top-left.</p>

  <hr />
  <p>An &lt;hr&gt; renders as three centered middle-dots.</p>

  <Quote variant="pull" cite="— Primary source, page 42">
    A centered in-flow pull quote framed by horizontal rules.
  </Quote>

  <p>
    Paragraphs can contain <MarginNote>a side comment</MarginNote>{' '}
    that inlines on narrow screens and floats into the left margin on wide ones.
  </p>
</Prose>
```

**Typographic rules `Prose` applies:**

- **Lead paragraph** — the first `<p>` renders in the serif font at the h2 size for a 1.45 leading.
- **Body rhythm** — `lineHeight: 1.75`, paragraphs separated by `1em`.
- **Headings** — h1/h2/h3 are serif, with h2 carrying an overline rule and h3 tightening to a reading-line-height.
- **Section break** — `<hr />` renders as three centered middle-dots with wide letter-spacing.
- **Inline code** — monospace, tinted with a border-colored chip, `0.875em` size.
- **Code blocks** — bordered, rounded, `colorSurfacePage` background with a subtle 2-color text contrast.
- **Pull quotes** — `<blockquote data-pull-quote>` renders centered with horizontal rules top and bottom.
- **Figures** — `<figure>` has a bordered-radius image and a centered caption; add `className="figure--wide"` to bleed past the container.
- **Margin notes** — `<small data-margin-note>` floats into the left or right margin at >=`BREAKPOINT_MARGIN_NOTES`, falls back to inline with a border accent on narrow screens.

The CSS is injected once into `<head>` (deduped via `useInjectStyles`) and consumes semantic tokens end-to-end, so every `Prose` block recolors with the theme automatically.

`Prose` forwards its ref to the outer `<div>` so consumers can measure, scroll, or transition the whole reading surface.

## `Quote`

A serif-italic blockquote with two visual treatments.

```tsx
import { Quote } from '@4lt7ab/content';

// Pull — centered in-flow with horizontal rules. Requires <Prose>.
<Prose>
  <Quote variant="pull" cite="— Annie Dillard, The Writing Life">
    How we spend our days is, of course, how we spend our lives.
  </Quote>
</Prose>

// Epigraph — larger, standalone. Works inside or outside <Prose>.
<Quote variant="epigraph" cite="— John Gall">
  A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked.
</Quote>
```

**Variants:**

- `pull` (default) — an in-flow pull quote framed by top/bottom horizontal rules. The styling is owned by `<Prose>` (which targets the `[data-pull-quote]` attribute); `<Quote variant="pull">` outside a `<Prose>` renders a bare `<blockquote>` without the typographic treatment.
- `epigraph` — a larger standalone blockquote with its own injected styles. Serif italic at `clamp(1.5rem, 3.5vw, 2rem)`, centered, bordered top and bottom. Works both inside and outside `<Prose>` — good for opening quotes, page epigraphs, or hero-level callouts.

The optional `cite` prop renders as a `<footer>` under the quote — harmless on either variant.

## `MarginNote`

Annotation that inlines on mobile and floats into the page margin on wide screens (`>=BREAKPOINT_MARGIN_NOTES`). `side` picks which margin — `left` (default) or `right`.

```tsx
import { MarginNote } from '@4lt7ab/content';

<Prose>
  <p>
    Main text runs through the page.
    <MarginNote>Left-side annotation, floats into the margin when the viewport is wide enough.</MarginNote>
  </p>
  <p>
    Another paragraph.
    <MarginNote side="right">Right-side variant.</MarginNote>
  </p>
</Prose>
```

Must be used inside `<Prose>` for the styling and positioning to apply — `<Prose>` owns the CSS that targets `[data-margin-note]`. On narrow screens the note is inline with a thick border on the chosen side. On wide screens it's absolutely positioned into a 200px gutter.

## `ThinkingCycle`

Inline text that scrambles into each word, holds, then scrambles to the next. The container width animates between words so surrounding inline content (punctuation, spaces) slides naturally with it.

```tsx
import { ThinkingCycle } from '@4lt7ab/content';

Building with AI tools is{' '}
<ThinkingCycle words={['powerful', 'wild', 'unprecedented']} />.
```

<LiveExample id="prose-thinking-cycle" />

**Props.**

| Prop | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `words` | `string[]` | — | Needs at least two. |
| `holdMs` | `number` | `2000` | How long each word stays visible. |
| `scrambleTicks` | `number` | `4` | Scramble iterations per character. |
| `tickMs` | `number` | `50` | Ms between scramble frames. |
| `staggerMs` | `number` | `30` | Delay between each character starting. |

The animation respects `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` — when set, words swap instantly without a scramble step. Widths are re-measured on font load and on theme change (since `font-family` may differ between themes), so the width transition always settles on the right pixel count.

## Styling model

Both `Prose` and `Markdown` inject scoped stylesheets once on first render (via `useInjectStyles` from `@4lt7ab/core`). The CSS uses semantic tokens throughout — `var(--color-text)`, `var(--color-border)`, `var(--font-serif)`, `var(--color-action-primary)` — so every prose block recolors with the active theme without component rerenders.

The two styling namespaces are independent. `Prose` uses `.alttab-prose` as its hook. `Markdown` uses `.alttab-markdown`. That separation is intentional: `Markdown`'s styles are tuned for the editable-mode UI and the code-block copy button machinery, while `Prose` assumes its children are already laid out in reading order.

## Where to next

- **[Layout](#/layout)** — how `Container`, `Stack`, and the page-envelope organisms frame a prose block inside an app shell.
- **[Theming](#/theming)** — the token layer that powers every color and font-family you just read.
